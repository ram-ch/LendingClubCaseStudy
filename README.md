# Lending Club case study
This Case study is about analysing the loans dataset to extract insights on what could be the reasons for loan defaults. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:   

1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.     
Hence, This case study mainly performs EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
